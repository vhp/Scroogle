Archived copy of the public domain code for Scroogle that I downloaded many years ago. 
If you are the origional author and want this removed please let me know. Glad to do it.

Scroogle was a meta search engine/proxy for google.com. It protected users privacy by hiding
the source of the request and rewriting requests. 

I was a big fan and was very sad when they shut down. Thanks for all your hard work. :)
